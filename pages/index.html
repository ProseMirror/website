<p>ProseMirror is an in-browser semantic rich text editor component.
This is what it might look like:</p>

<style>
.demoblocks {
  margin: 0 -20px;
}

.demoblock {
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: top;
  padding: 5px;
  text-indent: 5px;
  border: 1px solid white;
}

.demoblock:hover {
  border-radius: 5px;
  border: 1px solid #7cf;
}

.demoblock a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #777;
}

.demotip {
  z-index: 6;
  background: #ff7;
  border: 1px solid #ee5;
  color: #440;
  position: absolute;
  right: -20px;
  bottom: 2px;
  transform: rotate(-3deg);
  padding: 4px 15px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  pointer-events: none;
}

.ProseMirror-menubar-wrapper {
  margin: 4px -15px 1em;
  border-radius: 10px;
  background: white;
  border-color: #5ad;
}

.ProseMirror-content {
  outline: none;
}
</style>

  <h3>Control your Content</h3>

  <p>There is something of a gap between <a href="http://commonmark.org">MarkDown</a> textareas
  (limited, hard to use) and classical HTML WYSIWYG editors (content
  becomes a non-semantic blob). ProseMirror aims to fill this gap.</p>

  <p>It does this by decoupling its content model from HTML. Documents
  are represented with a JavaScript data structure, and their
  structure is described by a <a href="guide/schema.html">schema</a>
  that you can provide yourself. This gives you full control over the
  kind of <a href="demo/dino.html">elements</a> that may appear in
  your document, and the way they nest and relate to each other.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Users get a clean, consistent interface that allows them to enter
    only documents that fit the schema.
    <li>You get clean, consistent content that you can format
    or <a href="demo_lint.html">analyze</a>.
  </ul>

  <p>ProseMirror is open-source under
  an <a href="https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror/blob/master/LICENSE">MIT</a>
  license.</p>

<h3 id=features>Features</h3>

<p>ProseMirror is designed to allow customization and extension
throughout.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for <a href="demo/collab.html">collaborative editing</a>
  (<a href="http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/collaborative-editing.html">details</a>)

  <li>Export and import from ProseMirror's document format to HTML (or
  <a href="demo/markdown.html">Markdown</a>)

  <li>A clean, immutable document data structure (not the DOM) to
  program against

  <li>Document schemas that can be modified
  and <a href="demo/dino.html">extended</a> without having to rewrite
  the whole editor

  <li>A rich set of
  editing <a href="ref.html#commands">commands</a> that can
  appear in the menu or be bound to keys, and the ability to define
  your own

  <li>An API that easily integrates with React-style or linear
  dataflow based architectures

  <li>Menus and other UI elements live outside of the core library,
  and can be implemented according to your own preference (and the
  frameworks you may use)

  <li>A modular architecture to make sure you only load the code you
  need

  <li>A plugin system that allows you to easily enable additional
  functionality and package up your extensions in a convenient format

  <li>Changes are first-class values and can be stored, inspected,
  and <a href="demo_track.html">manipulated</a>
</ul>
