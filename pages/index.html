<p>Rich content editors should, ideally, produce clean, semantically
meaningful documents while still being easy for users to understand.
ProseMirror tries to bridge the gap between editing explicit,
unambiguous content like <a href="http://commonmark.org/">Markdown</a>
or XML, and
classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a>
editors.</p>

<p>It does this by implementing a WYSIWYG-style editing interface for
documents more constrained and structured than plain HTML. You can
customize the shape and structure of the documents your editor
creates, and tailor them to your application's needs.</p>

<h2 class=hr id=features>Features</h2>

<ul class=grid-list>
  <li>
    <h3>Collaborative editing</h3>
    <p>ProseMirror has built-in, ground-up, rock solid support for
    collaborative editing, where multiple people work on the same
    document in real time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Extensible schemas</h3>
    <p>Document schemas allow editing documents with a custom
    structure without writing your own editor from scratch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Modular</h3>
    <p>A modular architecture makes sure you only load the code you
    need, and can replace parts of the system as needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Pluggable</h3>
    <p>A plugin system allows you to easily enable additional
    functionality, and package your own extensions in a convenient
    format.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Functional</h3>
    <p>A largely functional and immutable architecture makes it easy
    to integrate ProseMirror into modern web apps, and confidently
    implement complex behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Unopinionated</h3>
    <p>The core library is small and generic, providing a base onto
    which very different types of editors can be built.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
