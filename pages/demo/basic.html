<h2>Editing with ProseMirror</h2>

<p>You can set up a basic ProseMirror editor something like this:</p>

<pre>
import {EditorState} from "prosemirror-state"
import {EditorView} from "prosemirror-view"
import {schema} from "prosemirror-schema-basic"

let view = new EditorView(document.body, {
  state: EditorState.create({schema}),
  onAction: action => view.updateState(view.state.applyAction(action))
})
</pre>

<p>That editor will be extremely basic—in fact, it'll be unusable
because it doesn't bind any keys yet. Read [this
guide](../guide/basics.html) to learn how to set those up.</p>

<h3>Demo</h3>

<div style="display: none" id="content">
  <h1>Using ProseMirror</h1>

  <p>This is editable text. Focus it and start typing.</p>

  <p>To apply styling, you can select a piece of text and manipulate
  its styling from the menu. You get <em>emphasis</em>, <strong>strong
  text</strong>, <a href="http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog">links</a>, <code>code
  font</code>, and <img src="/img/smiley.png"> images.</p>

  <p>Block-level structure is manipulated, depending on the current
  menu style, either through the top menubar, or through the
  “hamburger” menu to the right of the selected paragraph. This allows
  you to change paragraphs into headers or code blocks, to wrap them
  in lists or blockquotes, to unwrap them, and to insert things like
  horizontal rules.</p>

  <p>Try using the "indent” item in the menu to wrap this paragraph in
  a numbered list.</p>

  <p>And turn this paragraph into a code block.</p>

  <p>You can, if you know JavaScript, also go to the developer console
  and poke at the <code>pm</code> object to see what you can get it to
  do.</p>
