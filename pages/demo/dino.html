<h2>Extending the document model</h2>

  img.dinosaur { height: 40px; vertical-align: bottom; border: 1px solid #0ae; border-radius: 4px; background: #ddf6ff }

<p>Imagine we need to include exotic, site-specific elements in our
documents. These may be handles to other objects in our system
(documents, users, etc), domain-specific widgets, or, in the case of
this demo, dinosaurs.</p>

<p>ProseMirror allows you to define custom document elements, along
with serialization and parsing methods to convert them to and from the
document formats you are interested in. These then become proper
semantic element in your document format.</p>

<p>In the editor below, dinosaurs are first-class elements in the
document model. They can appear anywhere where text can appear.</p>

<h3>Dinos in the Document</h3>

<p>The full source code for this demo
is <a href="https://github.com/ProseMirror/website/blob/master/src/demo/dino.js">here</a>.</p>

<div id="editor"></div>

<div id="content" style="display: none">
  <p>You can insert dinosaurs by typing their names enclosed by
  brackets, such as <code>[pterodactyl]</code>. You'll get a simple
  completion tooltip as you do so, and can press tab to select the top
  completion. The menu bar also contains a dinosaur-insertion
  submenu.</p>
  <p>This paragraph <img class=dinosaur dino-type="stegosaurus">, for example,
  <img class=dinosaur dino-type="triceratops">
  is full <img class=dinosaur dino-type="tyrannosaurus"> of
  dinosaurs.</p>
  <p>Dinosaurs can be selected, copied, pasted, dragged, and so
  on.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The document-model customization API is not
finished yet. It is powerful enough to kludge in something like this,
but there's a bunch of work to do before we can write robust
extensions that interact properly with all parts of the system.</p>

<p>Next demo: <a href="lint.html">inspecting and manipulating documents</a>.</p>
